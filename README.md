## Reproducing results

*  Run the jupyter notebook **Agri_Challenge_Prepare_Data_Train_Test.ipynb** in order to preprocess data, train and test all at once. Jupyter Notebook contains various sections that allow you to run different steps.
*  Download data from the link provided in the notebook
*  You can also download processed data from these links:
